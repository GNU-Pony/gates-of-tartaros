These are templates you can used for your gotrc file.
If you are happy with them as is, you can include
them directly in your by gotrc file with for example:

     . /etc/gotrc-examples/no-empty-uer

Although, it may be better to copy the ones you are
using into a directory named /etc/got.d and include
them from there.

If you create any cool or useful extensions yourself
and do not object to licenses them under the GNU
