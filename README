Minimal replacement for agetty written in
GNU Bash with support for remote SSH login.

Note however that because of the use of GNU
Bash, rather than a compiled language,
gates-of-tartaros uses more memory than agetty.

You can configure your install to use dash
instead of bash by running make with the
argument BASH_SHEBANG="/usr/bin/env dash".
Doing so will more halve the memory using,
reducing the memory usage to slightly below
agetty.


To log in with over SSH type:
   user@host
   or
   user@host port

Usage:
	got TTY EXPORTS...

Example:
	got tty1 TERM=linux
