Minimal replacement for agetty written in
Bash and Python with support for SSH.

En example /etc/gotrc file is included,
it requires ponysay, util-say and KMS
support, and prints a random pony.

To log in with over SSH type:
   user@host
   or
   user@host port

SSH login requires that you have a
user without password called sshlogin
that have got-cmd as its default shell.

Usage:
	got TTY EXPORTS...

Example:
	got tty1 TERM=linux
