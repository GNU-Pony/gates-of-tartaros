Minimal replacement for agetty written in
GNU Bash with support for remote SSH login.
Note however that because of the use of GNU
Bash, rather than a compiled language,
gates-of-tartaros uses memory than agetty.

To log in with over SSH type:
   user@host
   or
   user@host port

SSH login requires that you have a
user without password called sshlogin
that have got-cmd as its default shell.

Usage:
	got TTY EXPORTS...

Example:
	got tty1 TERM=linux
